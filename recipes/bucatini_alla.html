    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Another recipe I've gently lifted from the paper of record's cooking arm. This one is really wonderful- I've only made it once, but it went over well. A salty dish- You're taking pancetta or prosciutto - salty meats - and there will be more salt added.</p>
    <p>It's important you get a block of your meat from the butcher, rather than sliced prosciutto (how it normally comes). I was lucky enough, that the provider I went to, gave me a new hunk after not requesting properly the first time!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>half pound unsliced pancetta or prosciutto</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>one red onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>pound a half canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>half tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>salt & pep</li>
        <li>a pound of dried Bucatini</li>
        <li>half cup pecorino or Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>cut the meat into chunks less than one half inch thick</li>
        <li>fry them in a saucepan with the olive oil over low heat for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>watch to make sure the fat is rendered out, and the meat is crisp</li>
        <li>remove and set aside</li>
        <li>saute the onion over medium for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>drain and chop the tomatoes, and add to the pan</li>
        <li>season with red pepper flakes & S&P, simmer 20 minutes stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>meanwhile, bring salted pot of water to a boil & cook bucatini according to package</li>
        <li>transfer sauce to skillet over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>add pasta and meat and cook for 30 seconds</li>
        <li>remove from heat, add cheese, then divide and serve</li>
    </ol>
