    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This soup! I make it all the time, although more often when it's less warm out. It's a yummy yummy soup that's hearty, has good nutrition, and isn't too bad to whip up</p>
    <p>I really recommend using homemade chicken stock for this bad boy. The recipe (as you'll see!) calls for a rotisserie chicken- if you buy it in advance, you can make some stock with the carcass.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>a few carrots or a small butternut squash, diced/chopped</li>
        <li>a good sized leek or two diced/chopped</li>
        <li>two celery stalks diced/chopped(skip if desired)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves chopped</li>
        <li>a tbsp each fresh thyme, rosemary</li>
        <li>salt n pep</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>5 cups stock</li>
        <li>cup o heavy cream</li>
        <li>16 oz (one pack) storebought gnocchi</li>
        <li>half a rotisserie chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>melt the butter in a large pot over medium</li>
        <li>add carrots, leek, celery, garlic, rosemary, thyme</li>
        <li>season with S&P and stir until veggies slightly soft - about 5 mins</li>
        <li>sprinkle with flour, then cook, stirring for 2 mins</li>
        <li>stir in the stock and cream and bring to boil over high</li>
        <li>once boiling, stir in gnocchi, reduce to medium, cook until gnocchi and veggies are tender (5 mins)</li>
        <li>stir chicken in towards the end. season to taste with salt n pep</li>
